Hi! I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at University of Houston majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My research focuses on machine learning and developing robust and efficient algorithms driven by both natural and clinical problems, including self-supervised learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, as well as fairness. I am advised by Prof. Hien V. Nguyen.

Prior to UH, I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science from Chonnam National University and M.E. degree in Material Engineering from Soongsil University.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
